## Repository Organization

This repository contains the backend components of the Ghost ZK proof system. The frontend application is available in a separate repository:

**Frontend Repository**: [https://github.com/gabrielrondon/ghost-frontend](https://github.com/gabrielrondon/ghost-frontend)

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Deploy a canister-based ZK proof system for private attestations
**Definition of Done**: A working canister that can accept user input and generate a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for a given use case (token ownership).
- ✅ ZK Canister successfully deployed to the Internet Computer mainnet with ID `hi7bu-myaaa-aaaad-aaloa-cai`
- ✅ Implemented real token balance verification with ICRC-1 and ICP tokens
- ✅ Proof generation and verification methods tested and operational

### 2. Develop API methods for proof requests and verification
**Definition of Done**: A complete set of canister methods that external applications can use to request and verify ZKPs.
- ✅ Implemented `prove_ownership` method for generating ZK proofs
- ✅ Implemented `verify_proof` method for validating proofs
- ✅ Comprehensive testing of API functionality

**Note**: We decided the use case to be proving the user has a specific token and with a certain amount (fungible tokens), not NFTs.

### 3. Implement anonymous reference generation for proof verification
**Definition of Done**: A mechanism for generating unique, shareable proof references that third parties can use to verify the validity of a ZKP.
- ✅ Anonymous verification reference generation
- ✅ Proof verification without revealing user identity
- ✅ Secure proof blob format for sharing

### 4. Test execution with an initial use case
**Definition of Done**: Successful end-to-end testing of a complete proof request, generation, and verification cycle.
- ✅ End-to-end testing of ZK proof generation completed
- ✅ Verification functionality tested with generated proofs
- ✅ Integration testing with external clients

## Repository Focus

This repository focuses exclusively on the backend components of the ZK proof system:

- **Canister Code**: The Rust implementation of the ZK proof system
- **API Documentation**: Interface descriptions for canister methods

## ZK Canister Integration Guide

The ZK canister provides zero-knowledge proof services for token ownership verification without revealing sensitive user information. Developers can integrate with this canister to enable privacy-preserving verification in their applications.

### Canister Details
- **Canister ID**: `hi7bu-myaaa-aaaad-aaloa-cai`
- **Network**: IC Mainnet
- **Interface**: Candid (DID)

### Interface Definition
```candid
type TokenStandard = variant {
    ERC20;
    ERC721;
    ERC1155;
    ICRC1;
    ICRC2;
    ICP;
};

type TokenMetadata = record {
    canister_id: text;
    token_standard: TokenStandard;
    decimals: opt nat8;
};

type TokenOwnershipInput = record {
    token_metadata: TokenMetadata;
    token_id: vec nat8;
    balance: vec nat8;
    owner_hash: vec nat8;
    merkle_path: vec vec nat8;
    path_indices: vec nat8;
    token_specific_data: opt vec nat8;
};

type Result = variant {
    Ok: bool;
    Err: text;
};

service : {
    prove_ownership: (text, TokenOwnershipInput) -> (variant { Ok: vec nat8; Err: text }) update;
    verify_proof: (vec nat8) -> (Result) query;
}
```

### Integration Steps
1. **Generate a Proof**:
   - Call the `prove_ownership` method with a principal identifier and token ownership details
   - Receive a proof blob that can be shared for verification

2. **Verify a Proof**:
   - Call the `verify_proof` method with the proof blob
   - Receive a verification result indicating validity

### Example Integration (JavaScript/TypeScript)
```typescript
import { Actor, HttpAgent } from '@dfinity/agent';
import { IDL } from '@dfinity/candid';

// Define the canister interface
const idlFactory = ({ IDL }) => {
  const TokenStandard = IDL.Variant({
    'ERC20': IDL.Null,
    'ERC721': IDL.Null,
    'ERC1155': IDL.Null,
    'ICRC1': IDL.Null,
    'ICRC2': IDL.Null,
    'ICP': IDL.Null,
  });
  
  const TokenMetadata = IDL.Record({
    'canister_id': IDL.Text,
    'token_standard': TokenStandard,
    'decimals': IDL.Opt(IDL.Nat8),
  });
  
  const TokenOwnershipInput = IDL.Record({
    'token_metadata': TokenMetadata,
    'token_id': IDL.Vec(IDL.Nat8),
    'balance': IDL.Vec(IDL.Nat8),
    'owner_hash': IDL.Vec(IDL.Nat8),

    'path_indices': IDL.Vec(IDL.Nat8),
    'token_specific_data': IDL.Opt(IDL.Vec(IDL.Nat8)),
  });
  
  const Result = IDL.Variant({
    'Ok': IDL.Bool,
    'Err': IDL.Text,
  });
  
  return IDL.Service({
    'prove_ownership': IDL.Func(
      [IDL.Text, TokenOwnershipInput],
      [IDL.Variant({ 'Ok': IDL.Vec(IDL.Nat8), 'Err': IDL.Text })],
      [],
    ),
    'verify_proof': IDL.Func([IDL.Vec(IDL.Nat8)], [Result], ['query']),
  });
};

// Connect to the canister
const agent = new HttpAgent({ host: 'https://ic0.app' });
const zkCanister = Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
  agent,
  canisterId: 'hi7bu-myaaa-aaaad-aaloa-cai',
});

// Generate a proof
async function generateProof(principalId, tokenData) {
  try {
    const result = await zkCanister.prove_ownership(principalId, tokenData);
    if ('Ok' in result) {
      return result.Ok;
    } else {
      throw new Error(result.Err);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating proof:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Verify a proof
async function verifyProof(proofBlob) {
  try {
    const result = await zkCanister.verify_proof(proofBlob);
    return 'Ok' in result ? result.Ok : false;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error verifying proof:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Obstacles and Risks

Throughout the development of Milestone 1, we encountered several challenges and identified potential risks that warrant attention:

### Technical Challenges

1. **Canister Limitations**
   - **Challenge**: The computational complexity of ZK proof generation is constrained by canister cycle limits.
   - **Mitigation**: Optimized algorithms and implemented efficient data structures to reduce computational overhead.
   
2. **Cross-Canister Communication**
   - **Challenge**: Interacting with various token canisters requires handling different interfaces and standards.
   - **Mitigation**: Developed adapter layers to standardize interactions across token types.

3. **Candid Interface Issues**
   - **Challenge**: Inconsistencies between the Candid interface definition and implementation caused integration difficulties.
   - **Mitigation**: Standardized the interface definition and ensured alignment between code and interface.

### Security Risks

1. **Proof Verification Integrity**
   - **Risk**: Compromised proof verification could lead to false attestations.
   - **Mitigation**: Implemented cryptographic verification with multiple validation steps.

2. **Privacy Leakage**
   - **Risk**: Potential correlation attacks could link proofs to users.
   - **Mitigation**: Ensured no identifiable information is stored in proofs.

3. **API Security**
   - **Risk**: Exposed APIs could be vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured.
   - **Mitigation**: Implemented input validation and rate limiting strategies.

### Business and Adoption Risks

1. **Integration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Developers may find it challenging to integrate with the ZK canister.
   - **Mitigation**: Created comprehensive documentation and example code.

2. **Interoperability Issues**
   - **Risk**: Changes in token standards or canister interfaces could break compatibility.
   - **Mitigation**: Designed adaptable interfaces and abstraction layers.

3. **Scalability Concerns**
   - **Risk**: As adoption grows, the system may face performance challenges.
   - **Mitigation**: Designed for horizontal scaling and implemented caching strategies.

### Future Mitigation Strategies

1. Conduct a formal security audit before the final release
2. Implement a monitoring system for canister performance and usage
3. Develop a more comprehensive SDK for developer integration
4. Create educational resources to improve understanding
5. Establish a feedback mechanism for early adopters

These challenges and risks have informed our development approach and will continue to guide our planning for future milestones. By addressing these issues proactively, we aim to ensure the long-term success and security of the project.
